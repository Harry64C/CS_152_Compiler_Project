# CS_152_Compiler_Project


Our language is one that is similar to c++ but is easier for writers to learn. 

The language is called A++ but the file extension name is app. 

Rules: 
1. In-line comments must start with #
   Multiline comments must begin with /# and end with #/
2. Variable names cannot start with a number or contain special characters. 
3. [ ] are used instead of { } in c++, respectively. The same is true for { } and ( ).
