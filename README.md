Code Example
● Integer scalar variables                                                inum x; inum y; inum avg;

● One-dimensional arrays of integers                                      inum arr{3}; inum arr{20}

● Assignment statements                                                   inum x ~ 1; inum x ~ y;

● Arithmetic operators (e.g., “+”, “-”, “*”, “/”)                         x plus 1; x minus 1; x mult 1; x divi 1; x mod 2;

● Relational operators (e.g., “<”, “==”, “>”, “!=”)                       x gt 1; x lt 1; x eq 1; x dne 1; x lte 1; x gte 1;

● While loop (including "break" and "continue" loop control statements)   until{x gte 1}[]; go; stop;

● If-then-else statements                                                 check (...) [...];or (...) [...];then(...) [...];

● Read and write statements                                               inp (x); outp (x);

● Comments                                                                #this is a comment

● Functions (that can take multiple scalar arguments and return a single scalar result)
